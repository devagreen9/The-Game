# THE-GAME!
## Connect 4

### Rules:

#### Quick Start: 
* Two players drop disks into table until 1 connects 4 of the same color (purple & orange).
* The one who connects 4 of 1 color will win.  

#### Detailed Instructions: 
* Player 1 places their piece into a section of the 6x7 table.
* Player 2 will do the same. 
* Each player will continue this action trying to connect 4 of their own color while also trying to block their opponent from doing the same. 

### Approaches Taken: 
* I did an extensive search of the different approaches people have previously taken. 
* I tried multiple ways to implement different approaches into my own. 
* I tried to use context & canvas but those were difficult properties to work with in a short ammount of time. I found myself scraping that idea late in the game, which can be found in previous commits.
* I even briefly attempted to use an array to build it. 
* In the end, I built a table.
* The table has functions to log the current position and player while also checking the win state.
